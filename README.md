This repository contains implementations of various deep learning models using TensorFlow and Keras. The assignments cover fundamental neural network architectures including autoencoders and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for different tasks such as image reconstruction, denoising, text generation, and sentiment classification.

Requirements

Python 3.x

TensorFlow/Keras

NumPy

Matplotlib (for visualizations)

Scikit-learn (for evaluation metrics)

How to Run

Install the required dependencies:

**pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib scikit-learn**

Execute each assignment script separately:

**python autoencoder.py   # Q1 and Q2
python text_generation.py   # Q3
python sentiment_analysis.py   # Q4**
